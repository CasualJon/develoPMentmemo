memoString += "W. Edwards Deming suggest that management is responsibility for up to 85% of the cost of quality.  For example, if you are implementing software and management group decides to use outdated or inferior hardware, the quality of the user experience can suffer and the project team has little ability to control that aspect of quality.</p>";

memoString += "<p>Similarly, given that it's a management responsibility to hire and staff a team within a project, the quality of team members as an influencing factor on overall delivery quality can be traced back to management. Deming believed that workers need to be shown what acceptable quality is, and that they must be aware that quality and the constant pursuit of improvement in quality are necessary elements to an organization or project.</p>";

memoString += "<p><b>TQM (or Total Quality Management)</b> asserts that process is the problem, not people. Every person and all activities undertaken are involved with quality, so it is a constant factor throughout a project or organization.</p>";

memoString += "<p>TQM stipulates that quality must be managed into the product or service and that quality improvement must be a core competency in the way business is done rather than the one-time effort of a unique task. So, quality isnâ€™t just the testing phase, but should be a principle behind design, development, implementation, training, and beyond.</p>";

memoString += "<p><b>Plan-Do-Check-Act Cycle</b><br />";
memoString += "Walter Shewhart is sometimes attributed credit as the \"grandfather\" of TQM (everyone wants credit!). Shewhart's efforts focused on statistical tools (such as control charts) to examine when a corrective action must be applied to a process.  In addition to creating tools to control processes he created the Plan-Do-Check-Act process: a process to manage quality into your processes.</p>";
