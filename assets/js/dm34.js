memoString += "<p><span id=\"preamble\">I start from the premise that everyone is busy and working their hardest, but constraints exist, so trust must be shared among team members recognizing that each is working to do the right thing in balancing priority, responsibility, and time.<br /><br />While managing my own balance, I might jeopardize anotherâ€™s when I shortcut staff work.</span></p><br />";

memoString += "<p><span id=\"vocab\">Completed Staff Work</span><i> is the study of a problem and presentation of a solution in such a form that all which remains to be done is for the boss to give approval or disapproval of the completed action.</i></p>";

memoString += "<p>Though the original author is unclear, the Doctrine of Completed Staff Work has a military provenance sourced to a memorandum issued during WWII. The memorandum succinctly outlines the principles of Completed Staff Work, empowering team members to champion solutions by breaking down problems and building strategic next steps within a recommendation for approval.<br />";
memoString += "This is what developing SBAR (Situation, Background, Assessment, Recommendation) and SCOPE (Subject, Challenge, Opportunity, Possibilities, Evaluatiuon) documents facilitate. <i>Present solutions, not problems</i>.</p>";

memoString += "In essence, the responsibility for critical thinking should always belong to you. As a Project Manager you are an engine of change, even in a collaborative environment where all shoulder some of the burden.</p>";

memoString += "Consistently offloading critical thinking to someone you report to doesn't build the favorable impression of you being a competent professional. And, offloading critical thinking to a team can create swirl and lead to inaction through the diffusion of responsibility.</p>";

memoString += "To drive change, think the issue through in advance and present a recommendation. It's the 21st century, everyone is always busy. How do you react when others merely dump a problem into your lap and expect answers? Besides, you're more likely to get your way if yo're the one constructing a well-thought plan.</p>";

memoString += "<p>Address problems with the intent of driving change by detailing the specific actions necessary to achieve the goal instead of passing critical thinking up the chain, or worse to someone who should be relying on your expertise.</p>";
