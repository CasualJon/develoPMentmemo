memoString += "<p>Computers have shot-term memory, long-term memory, a bus, a processing unit, a power supply... Essentially, we have the same things, just in different forms. So, your brain is like a computer.</p>";

memoString += "<p>Working memory (in your laptop, it's RAM) as noted above has a finite capacity of information it can temporarily store and manage. One test to judge how much <b>Working Memory Capacity</b> a person has is <i>memory span â€“ then number of words or numbers that a person can hold onto and recall in order</i>. <a href=\"http://www.human-memory.net/types_short.html\" target=\"_blank\">The average memory span for normal adults is around 7 items.</a>";

memoString += "<p>Say I'm only good at remembering 5 concurrent things to your 8: a low capacity means I might have less room to work with. It's not a problem or deficiency, but it's good to know your baseline. And, any load reduces what's available from capacity, so the higher the load the closer you are to <i>overload</i>.</p>";

memoString += "<p>Your ability to focus (and ignore distractions) is directly impacted by how much you're trying to balance at any one time. Without enough overhead to direct significant resources toward one task, productivity is low because distraction increases.</p>";

memoString += "<p>From my experience, the simplest remedy is a list.<br />";
memoString += "To get something out of short-term memory so you don't have to keep juggling it with everything else, while still ensuring you're tracking that item: get it onto physical storage. With reduced memory load you're less stressed and anxious, better able to focus and ignore distractions, and ultimately less irritable and more productive. Plus, it feels great to cross things off a list :)";
