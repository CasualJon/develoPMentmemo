					<p>Well, it's about time that I finally put this back up. I originally hosted the develoPMent memo through SquareSpace, but I prefer this method. Bonus: it's cheaper.</p>
					<p>To be open, I don't know that I'll be producing new content for the developPMent memo at this time. However, I would like (for myself and for you)
						 a repository for the memos originally composed. The site will be simple and built up gradually, but I hope you find the material helpful.

					<h2>Randomly Selected Memo</h2>

					<h5>This is more work.  I thought it would be easier.</h5>
					<p>
						True expertise is earned the difficult way: <i>knowledge acquired and skill cultivated through efforts to learn and assimilate new information over long experience.</i><br />
						<br />
						But being labeled an expert is sometimes thrust upon you.  Occasionally, that’s just the way work works.<br />
						But, being appointed a lead grants no wisdom.  Getting introduced by the honorific brings no insight.  Offering opinion for recognition’s sake builds no understanding.<br />
						<br />
						I do not say to ignore your accomplishments – you worked hard and deserve to be proud!  But, be on guard for unintended consequences of suddenly being seen as an expert.  In fact, it’s important to recognize if you are viewed as an expert because it could influence your opportunity to gain true expertise.<br />
						<br />
						Gaining expertise is a process of shaping and reshaping knowledge and skill through discovery and learning, it trains you to evaluate new ideas and information by their merits.  But, suddenly being thrust into the role of expert can make you more close-minded.<br />
						<br />
						In 2015, Victor Ottati and colleagues Erica Price, Chase Wilson, and Nathanael Sumaktoyo <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022103115001006" target="_blank">published their research into this topic in the <i>Journal of Experimental Social Psychology</i></a>.
						Essentially, our social norms grant experts some level to entitlement to their opinions. And believing yourself an expert without legitimate expertise could limit your intake of new opinions and ideas.<br />

							<i>Remember that knowledge of the right kind leads to humility.  The fully ripened ear of wheat, bends downward.  It is the little blade, that holds itself up so pertly.  It is the shallow brook that makes the loudest babbling among the pebbles.</i><br />
